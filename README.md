# lifemander

A helpful MTG life tracking app build primarily for the casual Commander(EDH) format.

## Status

This app was orriginally a fun little project to investigate the use of mobx and mobx-persist. The project is currently shelved but may be updated in the future. 

## Current feature set

Two player life tracking. Positive and negitive. Changes in magnitudes of 1 and 5.
Persistant life totals. Accidentally close the app? Don't worry your totals aren't lost. Just start it back up and they will be there.
Reset game button. 

## Planned features

Custom life change values.
Player customisation including name, colour and custom player counters for tracking commander damage, poison counters etc.
Option for additional players. Up to a max of 8, any more and even on tablets it gets a bit messy.
